## Trending Movies üé¨
Trending Movies is an Android app that fetches popular and upcoming movies from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) 
API and displays them in a list. The app is fully built using Jetpack Compose and follows the MVVM architecture pattern. 
It also supports offline mode by caching data locally.

## Features üöÄ
- Popular and Upcoming Movies: Browse through popular and upcoming movies.
- Movie Details: View detailed information about a selected movie.
- Offline Mode: When the device has no internet connection, data is loaded from the Room database.
- MVVM Architecture: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for better code organization and testability.
- Dependency Injection: Hilt is used for dependency injection.
- API Management: Data is fetched using Retrofit and OkHttp3.
- Local Database: Movies are cached in a local Room database for offline use.
- Image Loading: Movie posters are loaded using Coil.
